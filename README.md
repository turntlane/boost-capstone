## Technologies
I used `React`, `CSS`, `Three.js`, `Axios`, `React Bootstrap`, `Firebase`, `Firebase AUTH`, `Firestore` 

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm install axios`

## Approach
Keeping layout, styling, and functionality as clean and usable for the user. Naming conventions easily maintainable for Components and CSS. Each component has own CSS file for increased readability. 

## Status
[Boost] is completed. `Version 2` will be out soon.
